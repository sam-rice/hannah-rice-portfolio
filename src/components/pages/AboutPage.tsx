    "Hannah Rice is a movement-based performance artist living in Seattle, Washington.  She graduated cum laude from Cornish College of the Arts, where she earned a BFA in Dance in 2018.  Hannah has collaborated with choreographer and mentor Alia Swersky since 2018, producing, improvising, and engaging in ritual performance.  Their work has been shown at Base: Experimental Arts + Space, 12th Ave Arts, CO-, The University of Washington, The Good Shepherd Center, Cornish Playhouse and MadArt, among other Seattle performance venues.  She has also worked with Coriolis Dance Collective, Greg Mares at Hand Crank Films, 12 Minutes Max and choreographers Jody Kuehner, Bruce McCormick, Alice Gosti and Charlotte Boye-Christensen.  Hannah is also a core member of Dangerous Women, an activist theater company based in central Washington.  Additionally, Hannah continues to produce her own work in both rural and urban parts of Washington State. In 2021, her collaborative and interactive film titled Yellow House was displayed for a two month showing at the MAC Gallery in central Washington.  Her work always pays close attention to sonic spaces and has led her to her current sound collaborators Casey Adams, Rachel LeBlanc and Sandesh Nagaraj.  When she is not dancing, Hannah is engaged in creative writing, teaching Pilates, running in the mountains and dreaming up her next project."

  const statementIntro =
    "My work is research into the body as it relates to environment, sound and physical objects.  My practice seeks to challenge the assumed distinction between the living you and the sentient earth.  I explore this through set choreographic and improvised material generated for site-specific performance."

  const spaceIntro =
    "I take cues from architecture.  Lines of formalityâ€” of compositional integrity.  Forearm parallel to door hinge, eyes tracing baseboard, femur in line with cantilever beam.  I'm interested in pulling you into this space.  To bring you back to now as witness with the light pouring through the windows, with the rain against the steel roof.  Regarding the inevitable interplay of the environment in performance."

  const processIntro =
    "I often ask, how can I savor development and push against the impulse of presentation?  Prioritizing time to craft is a rebellion against the unstoppable forces of oppressive systems- a commitment to self, a commitment to nature, a commitment to researching the enigmatic wonders of living. It is an attempt to press pause on the slow motion combustion that is modern life.  To remove myself from the metal scraps flying through the air.  To remain honest, curious and glacial in the face of acceleration."

  const processSubIntro =
    "Documentation has become a big part of my work.  Recording spontaneous sounds in nature and of the body, moving against the vinyl floor.  Recording improvised successes and giant failures.  It is all practice."
